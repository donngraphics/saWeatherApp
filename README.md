This is a SwiftUI project from Sean Allen that I'm working through. This particular project is for a "weather app", so to speak. Though I'm finished with the first go round of the project (he might revisit in the "future" i.e. as I work this his lessons, because these videos are a couple of years old), I'm currently working on the challenges Sean laid out in one of his videos. Though the challenges have slowed me down, I really want to learn and understand these topics. I want to make a career out of this, and that calls for me to give an honest effort, as this is my last go round of any type of coding.


CHALLENGES
1. Build model and refactor HStack with an array (COMPLETED)
2. Get real data from a weather API
3. Build a TabBar that shows multiple Cities
